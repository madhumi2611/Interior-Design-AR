# Interior-Design-AR-Mobile-App-using-Unity
An Augmented Reality (AR) mobile application built with Unity URP that helps users visualize and design interior spaces by virtually placing 3D furniture models in real-world environments.

The app detects flat surfaces using AR plane detection and allows users to place, move, resize, and remove virtual furniture objects (like sofas, chairs, and tables) on those surfaces. It provides an interactive and realistic way to plan and visualize room layouts directly through a mobile device’s camera.

**Features**

**Real-time Plane Detection:** Detects horizontal surfaces using the device camera.
**Object Placement:** Select from a list of 3D furniture models and place them on the detected plane with a tap.
**Object Manipulation:** Move, resize, and remove objects intuitively using touch gestures.
**Multiple Object Support:** Place and manage several items in the same scene simultaneously.
**Scene Control:** Remove individual objects or clear all objects at once.
**User-Friendly UI:** Simple, minimal interface for easy interaction.
